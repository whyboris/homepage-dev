Born in Russia; came to the US with my parents at 11 years old. I studied mathematics in college, was a math (and SAT) tutor, middle- and high-school math teacher, and then became a web dev.

I'm proud to be a part of the [_Effective Altruism_](https://effectivealtruism.com) movement; I have been a member of [Giving What We Can](https://givingwhatwecan.org) for over a decade (giving at least 10% of my income to _cost-effective_ charities).

I'm also proud of the software I wrote: [Video Hub App](https://videohubapp.com), I hope you find it useful.

Currently I am spending time working on house stuff (building a kitchen, treehouse, a room in the garden, and numerous smaller projects).
